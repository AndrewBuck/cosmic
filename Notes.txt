Currently the 'zoom' button in the image galleries is not working, need to fix this.


solve-field - potentially useful commandline options:
--depth      try just 10 or so objects first then if it fails re-queue later with a deeper depth.
--cpulimit
--guess-scale
-ra, --dec, --radius


Login usernames should not be case sensitive.


allow users to upload a text file containing md5 or sha hashes of filenames to be checked against uploaded files to
ensure they uploaded correctly.



Have a system where a user can "log in" as an avalaible observer when they actually have their scope set up and ready to
use and are out observing.  Then if something like an alert notice comes in, or other similar types of needed
observations, they can be offered out to "active" users at the current time and they can respond with a yes/no on whether
they will switch to that offered target.  This way we can get very reliable response on selected targets.



When users donate to the site have it so their donation covers themself and another user to encourage people to donate.
On the donation form there should be an option to either choose a specific username as the other user, an email address
of someone who doesn't use the site with to email a redeem code to, or a choice to let the other user be chosen by us
or the site itself.



imhisto - iraf task that computes and prints a histogram of an image.  Should
          probably do this in 2 stages, first with bins across the whole range,
          then a second pass across the range that captures 95% of pixels.

          Astropy actually has an implementation of this so it probably makes
          more sense to use that.

inverse - iraf calculate an inverse fourier transform of an image

imcore  - standalone program for source extraction (automatically handles multi-extension fits files)
          http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/software-release/imcore

fitsverify - a fits file utility to verify a fits file does not contain errors.

fpack / funpack - a fits compression utility that leaves the fits headers uncompressed but compresses the image data.

Here is a paper on source detection - not sure if there is a software package that implements it:

Here is a paper on source detection in multi-spectral imagery.  Probably good for dslr submitted rgb images.

Here is a paper on estimating the completeness of a sextractor results file by
varying the input parameters to sextractor and seeing how the detection rate
changes as a function of the input parameters:

The DAMIT database contains asteroid shape models and lightcurve data from
lightcurve inversion.  This would be good to import to calculate scores for
target asteroids based on how well studied they already are, etc.  Also could
be used to show 3d models of asteroids on the site if we wanted to since the 3d
model files are also included in the database dump.

The Las Cumbres Observatory is a nonprofit group with a robotic telescope
network with global coverage.  We should look into collaboration with the,
either processing data produced by their scopes, and/or submitting observation
requests to them as we would with individual observers.
