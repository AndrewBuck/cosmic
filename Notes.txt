solve-field - potentially useful commandline options:
--depth      try just 10 or so objects first then if it fails re-queue later with a deeper depth.
--cpulimit
--guess-scale
-ra, --dec, --radius




allow users to upload a text file containing md5 or sha hashes of filenames to be checked against uploaded files to
ensure they uploaded correctly.



imhisto - iraf task that computes and prints a histogram of an image.  Should
          probably do this in 2 stages, first with bins across the whole range,
          then a second pass across the range that captures 95% of pixels.

          Astropy actually has an implementation of this so it probably makes
          more sense to use that.

inverse - iraf calculate an inverse fourier transform of an image

imcore  - standalone program for source extraction (automatically handles multi-extension fits files)
          http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/software-release/imcore

fitsverify - a fits file utility to verify a fits file does not contain errors.




Here is a paper on source detection - not sure if there is a software package that implements it:

Here is a paper on source detection in multi-spectral imagery.  Probably good for dslr submitted rgb images.

Here is a paper on estimating the completeness of a sextractor results file by
varying the input parameters to sextractor and seeing how the detection rate
changes as a function of the input parameters:
